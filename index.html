    <p>Hi, my name is Trevor. I'm a recent college grad. I graduated from The Pennsylvania State University with a B.S. in Physics. I've been learning alot about programming. Specifically how to program in
        python and how to analyze data. I've learned how to use pandas, matplotlib and numpy. Soon I will learn how to use sklearn and other machine learning tools. I've been currently working on an Android Project that
        currently is occupying my mind. It's an app that schedules alarms based on the position of the sun in the sky. It's not 100% complete yet, but it's working. It just needs a few things to make it really beautiful,
         like an icon and the ability to get your location in the background. Those features are just around the corner. You can test it out by clicking on the link below. I should warn you though. It was made for Android 10
         and the Pixel 3a. It might not work on your phone, but then again it might. I have to optimize the code for all APIs and screen sizes. 
    </p>

    <p>I have some other interesting coding projects. These project's are more complete. This set I like to call Euler's Projects because they're programs written to solve complex math problems given on the website Euler's Project.
         If you're not familiar with the site, I suggest you check it out. It's a really fun site if you're into taking the time to really think about a problem and come up with a solution. I think I need to come back to this site once again
         it was alot of fun. My solutions and the relevant problems are listed below. The solution I'm most proud of is problem 70. I came up the most elegant solution and then had to optimize it twice to come up with a solution that solved
         in a reasonable amount of time. Then I programmed it in C++ and got it down to 30 seconds or less. Then with the help of the Euler's Forums it came down even further to 2 seconds.

    <p>Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.
        The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1.
        
        Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.
        
        Find the value of n, 1 &lt n &lt 107, for which φ(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/φ(n) produces a minimum.</p>

    <p>I'll upload my C++ versions sooner or later. For now enjoy these. I'll also upload other Euler problems later, but they aren't as interesting as this one anyways.</p>
